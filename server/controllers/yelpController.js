/********
 Name: yelpSearch
 Description: The purpose of this function is to call the yelp 'SEARCH' api and retrieve data about restaurants that
 match the search request parameters (specified by the creation of an event). Given the returned restaurants, the
 function also calls the yelp 'BUSINESS' api to filter out restaurants that will not be available at the event time.
 The results of these operations are returned from the function as an unresolved promise.

 Invoked From: CreateEvent function in the event controller
 Expected Inputs: an object containing yelp search request parameters. This object may contain parameters as specified
 by Yelp at : https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search

 Expected Outputs:
 - Success: A promise object which resolves to return the restaurants specified by the search request paramaters and
 filtered (remove restaurants closed at) by the eventDateTime
 - Failure: Unresolved promise and error message indicating error. Enhancement needed to handle error scenarios more robustly.
